# kind-pyplot

This small Clojure library allows visualizing Python plots in current Clojure tooling using the [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/) convention.

The implementation is inspired by the [Parens for Pyplot](https://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2020/01/18/parens-for-pyplot/) tutorial by Carin Meier from Jan 2020.

Status: to be released as beta soon.
